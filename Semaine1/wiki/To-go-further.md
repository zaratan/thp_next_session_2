**Congratulations! You're done for the week!**

As you know, it is mandatory to go further. It's up to you to choose which topic to dig. My advice would be to :

  * play around with **FactoryBot**
  * play around with **RSpec**
  * add a **:name** attribute to the Item model
  * add a **Category** model, with the attributes **:name** and **:description**
  * add a **has_many :through** association between Item and Category
